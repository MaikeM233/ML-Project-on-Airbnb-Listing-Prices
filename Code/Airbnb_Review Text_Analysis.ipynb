We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.\\r<br/>The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner.

Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   \\r<br/>After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. \\r<br/>We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. \\r<br/>The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are “special” adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  \\r<br/>A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! \\r<br/>'),\n (2595,\n  \"Jennifer's place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.

Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We had a blast! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Thanks Jennifer! \\r<br/>'),\n (2595,\n  'I love this space.

She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station.

Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.\"),\n (2595,\n  'The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip.

In any case it’s a good workout :)'),\n (2595,\n  \"Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it.

We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!\"),\n (2595,\n  'This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.'),\n (2595,\n  'Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building!

I appreciate it.\"),\n (2595,\n  'First of all I have to say, that Jennifer is not allowed to sublet her apartment by her landlord. I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didn’t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away. From that point on I felt really unsafe there and always tried to hide from the landlord. <br/><br/>For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. <br/>The place was really clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed. <br/>The kitchen was clean and well equipped. <br/>Apartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro. <br/><br/>Also, what should be mentioned , the hallway is really narrow and the stairs are quite steep, so with a huge suitcase not ideal, as the apartment is walk-up to the 4th floor.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is alright, in my opinion it is a bit busy in that area and there are nicer places to live, bit that is just my personal opinion.'),\n (2595,\n  'Great location, convenient to everything. Very cool space and building.'),\n (2595,\n  \"Jennifer's apartment is a well-cared for studio in the heart of midtown Garment District, just a few blocks from Bryant Park. The huge skylight is so nice. The quality of light in the early afternoon is idyllic. It has a casual vibe with sound healing instruments, a bean bag chair, and eclectic decór. The A.C. works great. Jennifer was very friendly and inviting.<br/><br/>Midtown is well-known for its business + tourist vibe. The theatre district is a short walk away. Restaurants are plentiful, though the food is geared towards fast and American. I ate better when I just went for the higher end restaurants, as the quality of the others is questionable. (Hidden by Airbnb) reviews of restaurants in the area are inflated. Korea town is a few blocks away and has some better options. Check out Tonchin (best ramen), Fine & Rare (live jazz), and further north, Tao (cavernous Asian Fusion restaurant with a colossal Buddha statue), for unforgettable dining experiences. Culture on 38th is the best coffee shop around.<br/><br/>The apartment has no blackout curtains so expect a good amount of light 24/7. If you're light sensitive like me, this can be a problem. I slept with a sleep mask every night. Thankfully it wasn't noisy at night, other than the occasional garbage truck.<br/><br/>Lastly, something that Jennifer worked valorously to correct, but you should be aware of, is that there is a light odor from the pipes in the bathroom sometimes. The only way to tame the beast is to keep the fan on continuously, otherwise it becomes overwhelming. Hopefully she can get to the root of the problem, and it may be completely fixed soon after I write this review.<br/><br/>Overall, Jennifer's apartment is a unique find that will be a welcome escape from busy, touristy midtown. I especially recommend it for those who are not light- and smell-sensitive, and who like a casual space instilled with positive intentions.\"),\n (5178,\n  'MR.

The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!

The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more.

The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.

You cannot ask for more. Very close to Columbus Circle subway station and there were many little places to grab something to eat. There are 24 hours McDonald, Starbucks, 24 hours grocery store, Central Park, Shopping Mall and so on very close by. (2) Shun was a wonderful host. He is very flexible, kind, and communicative. He adjusted check-in, check-out time for me and even took care of my luggage on the day I was supposed to check out because I had to wait until 6PM to get in to the next accommodation arrangement. (3) Wireless Internet works very well, and TV in the room has many channels you can enjoy while you are in your room, (4) Fridge, microwave, some plates, and flatware in the room come extremely handy when you want to keep some drinks cold and have little snack without having to use the kitchen\\r<br/>\\r<br/>[What I did not like]\\r<br/>(1) It was very tricky to use shower temperature control.

The building is very old and the rugs look disgusting, but we did not care either.... until we spent the first 2 nights and we realised we were not alone. The room was heavily infested with bed bugs.  Out of the 4 nights payed, we could not sleep for 2 whole nights, I had to get medications for rashes that developed from the bites and I had our clothes and baggage sterilized because these bugs travel with you once you get them.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Other issues with the apartment:\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The headless photo mounted on the page for the apartment also prevented any easy identification of the person owning or managing it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The photos advertising the apartment did not correspond to the apartment.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would strongly advise you not to rent this apartment, specially if you suffer from any allergies or if you wish to sleep. \\r<br/>The worst part of the story, the bugs feed on blood and we had killed one and the stain stayed in the wall. When we came back from one of our tours, the stain was not there any more, which may mean that the host cleaned it and, hence, that he or she knew that the room was full of bed bugs.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I spent a lot of money on medications and lotions to get the rashes out of my whole body (even my face).

Enjoyed my stay a lot and would definitely stay again :)'),\n (5178,\n  \"My stay at this apartment was not the best experience, but if what you care about the most is a great location, then this is the place for you. The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks.\"),\n (5178,\n  'Perfect location for the show I was seeing- thanks to the host for offering this.'),\n (5178,\n  'The person (host\\'s friend) that was supposed to let us in the apartment at the schedule time wasn\\'t there, so we had to wait almost an hour, until the previous guest open the door for us. That person was still in the room, sheets all messy, dirty towels on the bed...nasty view. The host was already on his way to receive us due to the fact that his friend never showed up. He apologized and was quick to \"prepare the room\". Honestly, the fact that we had to wait wasn\\'t that big of a deal, hiccups happen. But the fact that after he prepare the room, it continued to look messy and dirty was kind of disappointing. To all of you looking to stay in NYC, be aware of Pros and Cons of this listing! Pros: location is excellent! Good neighborhood, very close to Central Park by Columbus Circle, lots of nice restaurants and shops nearby. This is what this listing is about. Also, he provided with maps, hairdryer, sun screen, scissors and that kind of essentials. There was a small working fridge, instant coffee, microwave and TV, which I don\\'t know if they worked, never used them.  Cons: On the other hand, the room and bathroom were really dirty, mostly the bathroom. Guys, I had to grab a cleaning brush and a bottle of cleaning product that was next to the toilet to clean the bathtub floor, because I didn\\'t dare to put my feet there, considering on how the rest of the bathroom looked. The sheets looked clean, but we didn\\'t dare to use the towels, we just used small ones that we packed just in case. The cover on the small sofa was also pretty nasty. Honestly, this is not a place to stay more than one night, and that\\'s why we decided to stay after seeing all this. If it would had been more that one night, we would have gone to our friend\\'s house in New Jersey, which it\\'d had ruined all our plans. Bottom line: If you don\\'t mind staying relatively cheap in the middle of the city, in a dirty place, this the listing to do so. At least neighborhood is safe. Otherwise, go to a different place, you got to be a care-free person to stay in a place like this, and have seen many dirty places to assimilate this. I come from a dirty 3rd world country, so there\\'s that. But never expected this in an Air bnb listing, mind you, is my first experience :( Good luck to you all! \\r<br/>P.S: The $15 cleaning fee are not being used towards that, I guarantee it!'),\n (5178,\n  'Everything was great!

Thank you!'),\n (5178,\n  \"My whole experience at Shunichi's place was perfect! Check in was easy. I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here. In fact, if I ever do return to NYC, this is the first place I'll check to find a place to stay.\"),\n (5178,\n  \"I will divide the evaluation, so you have a better point of view.

Shunichi is almost always out or inside his space, so you won't feel controlled. The bed was as announced and host offers a few more things as scissors, shampoos, some cuttlery, things that may come in handy. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Cons: room is tidy, but is quite dark (curtains could be washed too). Air conditioner works, but makes a lot of noise during the night (and you'll need it in hot summer). Bathroom is clean as far as you can see, but if you glance a little further, you'll notice some dirty spots. My towel was a bit dirty also, I had to use my bf's. Apt is on first floor (consider that if you carry heavy luggage). What seems to be living room is stacked with boxes and things -I understand is his place after all, but it may shock you when you enter. And kitchen is definitely a no to use it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>However, Shunichi is very respectful and shy, so he won't mess around you but will help you get the best out your stay.

It's a perfect location in Manhattan, close to everything you need. There's a small dorm refrigerator and microwave, toaster and hot pot in the room - much more than I expected.

I was able to leave my luggage until mid-afternoon on the day of check-out, which eased my travel around the the city.

If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel.

Here is what I found recently (mid October, 2017). <br/>Shunichi went out of his way (via text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living room. <br/>From Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10 (including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe.<br/>Basic needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed, if you expect “style,” then this is not a place for you. I would say that is it clean “enough,” but I did not take a shower. <br/>Keys: the key to locks of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a couple of minutes, almost called him (and I can’t really say what to do to get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine.<br/>Never having stayed in downtown NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichi’s place is about 6 houses in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches), only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!<br/>Would I stay there again? I would consider it, but I’d look around for another possibility, too.'),\n (5178,\n  'Was what I expected!

Great price compared to other similarly-priced listings, which only offer shared rooms. I quickly passed on the shared rooms! This private room is spacious, has really tall ceilings, and has many dated amenities. Very thankful the room has a mini fridge. Not many channels available on the TV, but with access to Shunichi's Wi-Fi service, your viewing options will only be limited by the number of your own streaming subscriptions.<br/><br/>Super location. In walking distance to so many Broadway shows, Times Square, subway stations, restaurants, Hell's Kitchen, Central Park  ... (and my new job!).<br/><br/>I left the bedroom window open, and was still able to sleep like a rock.

This is the most DISGUSTING place I’ve ever stepped foot in. Everything was dirty. This is a place that you wipe your feet before going outside, not the other way around. I can’t believe this is even an allowable listing. <br/>I couldn’t tell if bedding had been washed, stains on the bath towels, hair matted into a hairbrush that was sitting in what I assume was an attempt at an “amenity” basket. Cracks in walls and ceilings, dirt on the walls. Unidentifiable stains on the couch.<br/>THE BATHROOM OMG. Black mold literally everywhere. <br/>Needless to say I didn’t end up sleeping here. I was in the unit for about 30-45 minutes total while troubleshooting with Airbnb on how to get my money back. I was so anxious after my initial report and after submitting initial photos that I called back and the person that looked at my case and saw the photos said “omg that’s so disgusting”<br/>I honestly can’t believe the listing is still in existence. It derailed my entire weekend on NYC Marathon weekend trying to find last minute accommodations. Thank god I had a friend in the city that could find space for my friend and I.'),\n (5178,\n  'This place is in a great location a short walk to times square or the subway to head downtown.

You’re definitely only getting what you paid for but he was super nice and let us check in HOURS earlier. We landed at 7:30 am and he let us check in at 10am. It was easy getting to his place and the check in and out was a breeze.'),\n (5178,\n  'Great location at a reasonable price. Nothing misleading about the pictures or description of his place, it’s as posted nothing luxurious. Just a place to stay while we explored Manhattan majority of the day and really only used the place to shower and sleep.

But the room is basic plus clattered with furniture or stuff, that makes it feel too messy. Also, both bathroom and bedroom were not extremely clean. And when I first booked this, the host didn't even respond to me to welcome us. Then I asked a question in order to pay the remaining amount, and had to bring Air BnB in for him to reply. Better but still slow communication about check in. The woman was checked us in was lovely though. <br/><br/>All in all, we loved the location, but we wouldn't go back to the room for a drink. As long as you're out all day, it works.\"),\n (5178,\n  'Pros and cons. Location is amazing. The room was as described and had some nice touches many of the other “shared rooms” or just bedrooms had. Fridge, kettle, toaster, heater, couch, microwave. Room was clean and spacious. Apartment was easily accessed and we even were given the chance to drop our bags and get keys early before we checked in. Was like we had the entire place to ourselves. Never even saw the host. <br/>Would give this a much higher review if not for the bathroom. I am by no means high upkeep or expect much. Very low maintenance. But when there is black mould all over the bathroom it’s not only a cleanliness issue, it’s a health issue. It wouldn’t take much to remove the caulking, recaulk and scrub the bathtub clean. We were cold and damp with tired feet from being out all day and would’ve loved a soak or shower but there’s no way I was stepping foot in that tub. <br/>Other than the bathroom it was all what I expected.'),\n (5178,\n  'A great place to spend the night, very close to lots of attractions.'),\n (5178,\n  'Great location, great amenities, great flexibility for checkin and luggage storage.

The room is very simple, but very comfortable, hard bed (I hate soft beds) nice pillows everything changed clean and fresh!

The bed is quite comfortable.<br/><br/>But I do want to point out two things:<br/>1, while the location is very convenient, it is a lower-level apartment facing one of the busiest streets in the city. If you stay over the weekend, you WILL hear cars (including sirens) and (very loud) pedestrians very late at night. I'd suggest bringing some earplugs or noise-canceling earphones.<br/>2, the apartment is old, and definitely not spot clean.

It is on a busy corner which is great for getting out and seeing the city but yes is noisy at night and made it difficult to sleep one of our nights.

However, after Cynthia recovered from the shock to her cleanliness gene, she quickly forgave me with the admonition, “NO SHOES IN THE HOUSE.”\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Cynthia’s blended energy drink in the morning enabled me as a 79-year-old broad to keep up with my young sidekick Judy.  Cynthia became our “House Mother,” waiting for our safe return at night with our daily report.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The most surprising revelation on this trip was how sweet and helpful the local New Yorkers  are to tourists.

'),\n (6990,\n  \"This is, indeed, one of New York's most-unique destinations.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Cynthia is an internationally-known visual artist with formal architectural training, and her home is the product of 22 years of sustained artistic focus. The photos are accurate but cannot capture a myriad small details such as the elegant solutions for concealing piping and wiring runs, or for ensuring adequate airflow between the lofts and open areas. At one point, I got a glimpse of a concealed wiring closet as she relocated her wifi base station -- I was impressed by the carefully-designed infrastructure that lies beneath the sumptuous exterior. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>As an extra treat, Cynthia's artwork graces the walls. The overall effect is stunning, like living in a bohemian fin-de-siècle palace -- admittedly a compact one, but a palace, nonetheless.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Cynthia herself is the epitome of the perfect hostess.  Her warmth and generosity is beyond compare. Her morning smoothies are the perfect metaphor -- healthy, fresh, and sustaining.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Living successfully in a small shared place requires the willingness to balance intimacy with privacy, and she handles that balancing act with effortless grace. In the last week of my two-week stay, I fell ill. Cynthia went overboard to ensure that I was comfortable, even to the point of getting chicken soup for me! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There is a large community of people around Cynthia, some drawn initially by her miniature palace.

I spent all days outside and made my daily reports after that in the blue room. I often finished at midnight.  The days were fully planned. So I was happy to be in a place next to the subway. Cynthia gave me some advices, called a taxi for me, and I loved her smoothies in the morning. Thank you for that very much, Cynthia! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>But I would like to point out a few things which should be mentioned. The pictures do not show the true dimensions of the blue room. The blue room is only about 6  square meters bed included. There is only a bench to sit on with no backrest. Stairs lead you to your bed. The bed goes over the floor. The room is open to the ceiling. Underneath is place for your clothes as well as on the opposite side. Real space to live in is therefore very very narrow.  The room is not separated enough. Everybody in the flat can hear everything you say.  There is no privacy in that room. \\r<br/>There was not a single table with a chair in normal size in the kitchen nor in the living room nor in the blue room. I found a few bar stools in the kitchen, one of them I could use  in my room to reach my laptop. If you prepare your meal in the kitchen you have to eat from the working place sitting on a bar stool or standing. The fridge is too small for more than 1 person if rooms are booked. There is no microwave. The flat is shoe free, but Cynthia did not say that she does not like sandals or slippers. She walks barefoot and wanted me to do so or in my socks. I do not like that.  The place is beautiful, but to pay 95 $ for a room of 6 square meters?  Cynthia is nice at one hand. But she gave me the feeling that she cared at first about every piece in her flat, then about her guest. I would wish to see more respect for the dignity of guests from different countries with different aspects of life. Do I recommend? For people who like such very small places, yes.\\r<br/>\"),\n (6990,\n  'Cynthia  makes you feel at home immediately , and her home is  a fabulous and special  place to stay when visiting NYC .

It's a continual work in progress with creative ideas flowing.  The two weeks I spent with her flew by.  As it was, we ran out of time for Raman noodles!

She certainly has been able to create the feeling of an entire bedroom in the two cozy niches she has put together. She is a smart and charismatic lady. Always concerned about one's comfort.

I would highly recommend staying here if you want to get away from the \"touristy\" part of the city & explore the neighbourhoods. She is right in the heart of the Upper East Side. It was a wonderful stay. Here is my review: long & hopefully detailed enough. Cynthia as a host was fantastic. She had booked a car service for me to & from the airport (cheaper than a cab), & greeted me with open arms when I arrived. She immediately struck up conversation; this girl can talk, & her conversations are intriguing & wonderful. She respected that I wasn\\'t a morning person, & kept quiet in the mornings. She let me borrow her umbrella during the one day that it poured. She gave me a subway map & explained the lines to me. She provided me with a list of nearby cafe\\'s, restaurants, & grocery stores. She also gave me the low down on what\\'s up with the museum admissions... I suggest staying with her if you want to know about that as well. Overall, she was very kind & helpful & I appreciated it all. The apartment itself looks exactly like the photos & is so thoughtfully & artistically designed & detailed. It was also extremely clean! Staying here was an experience in itself. Keep in mind the \"no shoes in the apartment\" rule is a strict one; all shoes are kept outside. Cynthia walks around barefoot, & I was comfortable doing the same, but if you aren\\'t, make sure to bring socks or slippers. I found the loft very comfortable after my days of wandering around. There is an air conditioner up there that you have control over, which was very nice. The room was small but cozy, & the only thing worth mentioning is that the walls of the room & loft do not go all the way up to the ceiling so you will hear everything in the apartment. Also, the door to the room is see-through, so you do not have 100% privacy. Changing in the little dressing room was a bit tough for me at 5\\'4\" tall; consider changing in the bathroom if you are taller. The rest of the apartment is perfect. The area is wonderful. A pharmacy & Starbucks & a subway station within a block walk; Central Park steps away with the Reservoir greeting you when you enter. Museum Mile is close as well. Getting down to Brooklyn Bridge took about 20 minutes on the express lines & another 5 down to Bowling Green & Battery Park. Not too difficult to get to Times Square either. Overall, fantastic location. Lots of cute shops & places to eat. Very non-touristy feeling.

There are lots of grocery stores, restaurants, and things to do in the area, and walking around was pretty safe at night. Central Park is a five minute walk, the subway is 90 seconds away, and there's also the metro museum of art about a 15 minute walk away.

Cynthia is an accommodating host who will attend to any requests and needs to make her guests feel comfortable and safe. An example of this is when there were only two eggs left and I had to get to the airport that morning. Cynthia offered to let me have those two eggs. An egg-cellent gesture I must say. <br/><br/>Cynthia will also show you around the city of NYC, as she has lived there for many years. She is quite an expert with the arts and culture and she will make sure to shape you any local favorites around the Upper East Side! Come in with an empty stomach for a majority of your trip because you will be EATING. Not just eating for the sake of eating but eating till you drop because the food is amazing. <br/><br/>So if you can’t tell I enjoyed my stay and loved Cynthia as a host, then I don’t know what else to tell you but to book this place and find out for yourself if this place is worth the hype. Just one thing though. Make sure to follow the house rules. Cynthia is on top of it (As she should be! It’s her house!) and will keep you in check with lights, AC, doors, kitchen rules, etc. Its only fair to respect her rules when she is going to show you a great time in NYC.

I'm really picky with food, so usually for me its a challenge to find store were I can find something I can eat, but this place was amazing.

Columbia University is close, and its an amazing place to visit.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>You also have a cinema on 125th at USAHarlem, which present AMC movies.

Also, he provided with maps, hairdryer, sun screen, scissors and that kind of essentials. There was a small working fridge, instant coffee, microwave and TV, which I don\\'t know if they worked, never used them.  Cons: On the other hand, the room and bathroom were really dirty, mostly the bathroom.

Matt was pleasant enough to deal with, he carried my heavy luggage up the stairs, and in my contact with him for the rest of my stay, he did respond back timely for the most part. Although, when checking in, you\\'re given a ring with 4 keys, and aside from showing me the key to enter the building, I struggled a bit to figure out which door the other 3 keys went to.<br/><br/>Also, while it may have been mentioned, but quite skimmed over that I was caught off-guard, was that you will probably be sharing the apartment with another individual.  I had stepped out of the apartment, to come back in, hear a voice, and then looked over to see a stranger there that I wasn\\'t expecting - although the other guest turned out to be very nice with great conversation shared.<br/><br/>Upon entering the apartment and given a tour, I was shown and told that the bathroom tub faucet was leaking and they were waiting for a plumber. I came to find out, once again from other reviews and Luiz, that it had been severely leaking for at least a week, if not longer. On top of the leak, the tub has pretty bad draining issues. Friday night, soon after the other guest showered, I went to go get my shower, only to find that the tub was filled about halfway (which was roughly between 6 inches to a foot) with water, which didn\\'t drain at all. I discovered the standing water at around 11pm, and it wasn\\'t until the next morning around 8am that it was taken care of.<br/><br/>I had messaged Matt about it, to which he tried getting into contact with Luiz and failed. And once I called Luiz myself in the morning about it (after messaging him a few hours earlier with no response), I was told to grab a paper towel to see if there was hair in the drain, and if not, he couldn\\'t do anything about it and I would need to find somewhere else to go to be able to shower (cause at that point, I had gone past 24 hours since my last shower).<br/><br/>I did get a paper towel and managed to indeed find and remove less than 10 short hairs, which did help the water drain, but it was so little to cause a draining issue that big that there has to be an underlying issue inside the pipe. Plus with the constant flow of water, the water was draining at the same rate the water was filling it. However, it didn\\'t drain quite enough and the other guest had to grab a pot and bail the tub water a couple times into the kitchen sink to get it back to \"normal\".<br/><br/>Then my final complaint with the tub, besides the very temperamental temperature controls of the shower, that the tub is set up high with tiled steps that go up to it, and the tub itself is very narrow. I felt very anxious while showering as I have slipped and fallen in a shower before (not this one), and it didn\\'t feel safe.<br/><br/>Moving on, the toilet situation wasn\\'t the greatest either. The toilet was in an entire separate room not only from the shower, but from the apartment. It was in a little room right off the main hallway and stairs. As someone I know called in, it\\'s what is known as a water closet, which is aptly named in this case because the room is the size of an actual closet. I didn\\'t measure it, but my best guess was that the dimensions were about 3-4ft by 4-6ft in size, if even that. It was smaller than a public restroom cubicle.<br/><br/>While it appeared fairly clean, albeit some cobwebs in the corner, it was ridiculously troublesome to deal with. While I\\'m short (5\\'2\"), I\\'m a very plus sized person, who also tends to deal with some gastrointestinal issues, and so I spent a bit of time in there, and I could hardly stand and clean myself after use because of the tiny size of the room. Which resulted in me having to go about cleaning myself in a very unconventional way which was a huge inconvenience. <br/><br/>Plus the toilet itself is up on a wooden platform which, while I didn\\'t initially notice, has some evident water damage and wood rot issues right under the toilet, cause the toilet itself to sink a bit and to shake much more than it should. Once again, as a heavy person, this was a safety concern of mine.<br/><br/>Although apparently I got lucky in that right before I checked in, an air conditioning unit was put in the window of my room, which I found out from the other guest as the place is not air conditioned that well and, since it was June, it got very hot in areas without the AC inside the building and apartment.<br/><br/>All in all, while the apartment is definitely in a very convenient, albeit not very safe-looking area of the city, I could not stand to deal with the plumbing/toilet issues for the rest of my stay.

Dies war ein Thema, über das wir uns mit ihr unterhalten haben, bei dem klar wurde, das sie verstärkt Wert darauf legt, dass die Schuhe an der Tür ausgezogen werden und die Hände regelmäßig desinfiziert.<br/>Die restliche Wohnung war relativ sauber. Als sie uns beim Check-In die Wohnung zeigte, fragte sie, wann ich gebucht hätte, weil sie seit kurzem Geld für das Frühstück nehmen würde. Da dies zu dem Zeitpunkt meiner Buchung aber nirgendwo stand, war das Frühstück noch inklusive. Dieses war in Ordnung, wobei ich diesbezüglich angesichts der vielen Bewertungen höhere Erwartungen hatte. Die Auswahl war nicht besonders groß, aber es ist für jeden etwas dabei.<br/>Alles in allem hatten wir nicht viel Gelegenheit, mit Agnes zu sprechen.

This was an issue we discussed with her, and it became clear that it was important for her that we take off the shoes on the door and use sanitizer regularly. The rest of the apartment was relatively clean. When she showed us the apartment at check-in, she asked when I had booked because she had started taking money for breakfast recently. Since this was nowhere at the time of my booking, breakfast was still included. This was fine, although I had higher expectations regarding the many reviews. The selection was not particularly large, but there is something for everyone. All in all, we didn't have much of an opportunity to speak to Agnes.

I have to start by agreeing with the comments left by the French family about 2 months ago. This house is NOT child friendly. The upper balcony does not have handrails that would conform to European Standards and would be considered wrong in any US State. This is the same for the stairs and handrails leading up. A child or a small adult could potentially fall through and be badly injured. This is a serious hazard and should not be ignored. As you arrive at the property the garden looks off putting as soon as you see it. The garden furniture was unusable, dirty, slimy and wet. The garden has an air of neglect add to that the gravestones and the look is of a disused cemetery, brilliant for Halloween but that is only one night in the year. To access the front door you have to walk through the yard area of another rental property, not too big a problem but the property we were in couldn’t be locked (also noted by other reviewers) and while the garden couldn't be penetrated by even the New York Fire Dept (once the first gate is locked) the property feels vulnerable. It would also invalidate any theft insurance should it be part of your holiday insurance cover. The fire pit is a grouping of stones in the middle of which ashes have been left. The pathway to the house is of flagstones, which are uneven and badly spaced. You couldn't push anything that is wheeled along it. The hammock is a nice touch, as are the outdoor lights and we were encouraged to pick apples. Inside the house is a pleasant surprise. The space is light and spacious. There is enough seating for 5 of us. But no bedding had been left for the fifth member of our party. The bed on the ground floor had hairs in it, (I wasn't told of this until the holiday was almost over, as our friends were too embarrassed) and the upper floor 5th person bed sagged because one of the support straps had snapped. There was no space for clothes for the three people on the upper floor so we had to move Olivia's clothes and belongings inside the wardrobe. While we appreciate and enjoy the reminders that we are in someone's home there was the sense that it had been walked out of rather than left ready. Our next problem was the upstairs toilet blocking. This we managed to fix, well before John came to do it. We also had to remove the plug in the sink upstairs. It was blocked and was full of hair. Not a nice job!

A very unique find. <br/><br/>However, there were many setbacks with this listing. To begin with, we arrived to find no keys in the mailbox. After several calls in to Olivia, we were finally told the owner would be by soon to let us in. We stood on 3rd street with all of our luggage for about 20 minutes until we could be let in. An inconvenience, but not a major problem. <br/><br/>Once the owner let us in, he proceeded to make himself a drink, plug in his phone and lie down in the hammock.

We were very uncomfortable and unsure of how to handle the situation, but we finally asked him to give us some privacy so we could get settled in.

We found this very odd, and Olivia became quite perturbed with us. After agreeing to disagree about what is acceptable when someone is renting your property, Olivia never checked in on us again. We were never asked how things were going or if there had been any further issues. <br/><br/>Which unfortunately, there were. The house was not clean when we arrived. Dishes were not washed, there were still items from the last renter in the bedroom and the shower was filthy.

Also, he sometimes asks for things without clarifying. For example, during our stay he asked us to leave our keys out on the table for someone to pick them up (without any prior explanation why). During another day, he asked us to open to front door for someone (without prior warning; which is pretty scary for 4 women!). However, if you press him for more information or clarification he will do so. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>3) Poor coordination of tenants: When my friend arrived, the place was dirty (towels on floor, food in fridge; unmade beds). I don\\'t think he arranged for the cleaners to come in between us and the last tenants. When I notified him of this, he called the cleaners and they came. Now, the day we were leaving the next set of tenants woke us up at 11:00am wanting to come in. I guess he double booked us and there was some overlap with the timing. We had to rush to get our stuff packed and cleaned in a short amount of time while the cleaning ladies were cleaning around us!

The bed listing is inaccurate - both rooms have double/full beds.  This may not be a big deal for some, but for people 6 ft or taller, a double bed is too short.  We only looked for places where the master had a minimum queen size bed.  We hope the owner corrects this listing soon so others do not have the same issue.<br/>2.

I couldn’t believe that the door wasn’t secure enough for this to happen.  I was going to call the cops but I managed to scare the guy away by showing him my knife. Thank God he did not return but that definitely was a scary situation that could have gone left quickly. I explained to Hannah all of my concerns and she didn’t do anything to resolve the issues.  She offered to call the cops when I notified her of the drug attic on the property. I feel a more serious action was needed such as doing something to make the door more secure. What if that man would have hurt me? God forbid. What if he comes back and hurts the next person who rents?

First is the rate per day for the whole place for the month came out to $133, so adding on an additional $150 for someone sleeping on the couch seems unreasonable and down right predatory. Second she admitted that the guy above me had an extra guest that got to stay for no charge cause she had been given a heads up. <br/><br/>I honestly didn\\'t think about needing to let he know but I probably should have, however that is no justification for letting someone do it for free and charging me a ridiculous amount.

I told her I wanted it done through AirBnb so there would be a record as I was getting a really uneasy feeling about trusting her.<br/><br/>I did not accept the $150 per day and instead offered what was 1/3 of the daily rate for the extra guest, which seems very reasonable seeing how they has hosts have literally nothing extra they have to do.<br/><br/> After this I got a message from AirBnb saying she\\'d cancelled the remaining 10 days of my reservation and had to vacate the premises.

We had to resort to using a lint roller to remove as much of the hair as possible.

Mariko said a cleaning person did come, but oddly the fridge and freezer were left with the last guest’s half eaten and some spoiled garbage. When we informed Mariko of this, she told us to throw it out ourselves.<br/><br/>We very soon spotted the first of many cockroaches. When we told Mariko, she took her time responding to the problem. She first just got us some crappy amazon roach traps which did not work. Then a while after she had her landlord’s buddy come, who did very little to solve the problem. When it of course did not go away, it took weeks for her to take more action. And again, that action was incredibly insufficient: her landlord came and sprinkled a bit of powder.

This was probably sometime in March and the treatment lasts for 6 months, so anyone coming in September (2022) or later there WILL BE ROACHES.<br/><br/>We also know for a fact that our apartment was creepily entered several times without us knowing while we were at work as the thermostat had been changed.<br/><br/>At the very end of our stay we found what we believed to be a bedbug. We informed Mariko of this, and her response was that she would tell her landlord, and that we needed to keep more neat and tidy. Meanwhile my girlfriend was getting new bites every night. I called an exterminator who said they believed it was a bedbug, and this was the last straw. We were horrified of bringing bedbugs home, and we knew that Mariko would be too cheap and negligent to do the right thing with so little of our money left to lose at this point. I fought it through airbnb who thankfully altered our checkout time beyond Mariko’s control.<br/><br/>Only when her precious money was at risk did Mariko get an inspection from an exterminator of her choice who, surprise surprise, did not say it was a bedbug. Because we obviously left in a rush and a struggle, to put all out belongings in garbage bags and somehow prepare to move to a new location, we were unable to leave the apartment perfectly clean. Mariko left us a nasty review because of that.<br/><br/>She claims that we stole things because I once opened a door that had an opened lock on it for a roll of toilet paper and paper towels. She informed me that it was actually meant to be locked, because she uses much of the very little space to store her belongings, and does not provide these amenities to guests.

It was not the right place for us. <br/>We are respectful, neat and tidy people and tried to abide by Arlette's reasonable house rules, yet we still seemed to be imposing by being there.<br/>Whilst there are many favourable reviews of Arlette’s lodging, they do not match our experience. We booked for 4 nights and left to find other (expensive last minute) accomodation after the second night. That says everything as we are easy going and have never done this before. Personal feedback left for us by previous hosts is excellent.<br/><br/>It is her home and we respected that, however we did not feel at home or trusted and subsequently left. Airbnb provides income to many, but should also be a service and guests should feel welcome. <br/>I know it is a cheap room for New York, but we were severely disappointed as this was the end of our trip and we were left feeling flat and uncomfortable about the whole experience. We were looking forward to staying in a real NY apartment with a local resident. <br/>The facts are: The fold out bed for the third person was broken and leaned to one side resulting in a restless night. It had been previously taped back together. <br/>The dog is cute but barks incessantly when the host is not there. There is an immediate dog smell when you enter the apartment. <br/>The room is cluttered in an effort to provide everything. The kitchen has dishes and washing everywhere and is not as pictured in the profile.  <br/>On our second morning we were showering and were met with Arlette at the door, pounding in panic as the water had leaked through to the apartment downstairs, which she said must be because we didn't completely close the shower curtain. We had.<br/>Then 5 mins later, more knocking, whilst we were trying to get dressed, claiming the water was still leaking.<br/>The bathroom floor was dry.

We know Arlette will read this and may reply twisting our words, making us out to be the bad guys (already she has claimed we left the place in a bad state - untrue). She has done to any other negative reviewers. But the truth is, she needs to listen to the complaints and make it a better experience for all.

So far it seems that every negative review that is left, the host replies back saying how the guest in fact, was the problem. <br/><br/>Maybe we caught her off guard initially when I misunderstood the directions for arrival and maybe that’s where it all started. There were many “ rules “, one of which I thought was fair like removing shoes before entering. But things such as don’t brush your hair and get it on the floor, put the hair in the waste basket. Don’t wheel your luggage on the floors outside of the bedroom, don’t put luggage OR backpacks on the beds ( this was a VERY tight space so there were not many options for storage ). She told us that we could only hang out in the living room if she wasn’t in the living room. No eating in the room. You can eat only breakfast there and it has to be in the kitchen and there is absolutely no cooking. “ Who’s going to unlock the door every time? Who’s going to sleep where in the room ?

The larger bed had a dip in the middle that molded us into tacos, the smaller bed for one person had several metal bars running under the mattress.  <br/> <br/>The bedroom was small and so was the bathroom. The bathroom door didn’t even close all of the way so if you do stay here I hope you are very comfortable with the people you’re with.

The stay with Arlette was interesting to say the least and made us appreciate our next Airbnb in Boston on an extreme level. <br/><br/>The location was pretty decent & near a major subway line.',\n  -0.0022624434389140295),\n (708374,\n  'We are seasoned travelers, read her Airbnb write-up and were prepared for an older building in a good location.  Since we needed the extra sleeping area (sofabed in living room), we worked out the additional payment with Arlette and she confirmed verbally she would be in the Catskills and not residing in the unit during our stay.  We followed the directions to get into the unit and we arrived without a problem.  Things went downhill from there.  The \"peaceful neighborhood\"  advertised has a subway line rumbling loudly just outside the front window along with numerous police cars and other noisy vehicles.  The promised  \"room darkening shades\" actually consisted of an aged,  discolored, damaged pull that did not darken much of anything.  After spending a sleepless night, we quickly went out to purchase a \"white noise machine,\" earplugs and a sleeping mask.  There is a private bathroom (about 3 ft X 3 ft in size), but it has a child size sink, no storage, a tiny shelf that tilts, a door that doesn\\'t close and a small adjacent shower stall with a \"squirting\" showerhead.  The sofa bed was OK, but when I went to use the hall bathroom in the middle of the night (so as not to disturb my wife in the bedroom with the \"open door\" bathroom), I received a call from Arlette the next morning saying that the hall bathroom was hers and not available.  She had viewed me remotely from a security camera that unfortunately includes the hallway instead of just focusing on the entry door and outside windows.  Thank goodness I was wearing some sleep shorts.  The call was one of several in the first 24 hours (way too many and way too long) which seemed more to read off a litany of things we should do (how to close the shower curtain, where the living room light switch was - she mentioned this four times) and shouldn\\'t do in her apartment (but no information on meaningful items such as operation of the heat/AC).  She then stated she \"needed\" to return to Manhattan to pick up a phone, but would be leaving again the next day.  While she was in the unit with us, she \"corrected\" actions such as using a drinking glass other than the one assigned to our table setting; cleaning and rinsing our used silverware improperly, placing items (water bottles) on the kitchen table, etc, etc.  It became evident she had a specific regimen that had to be adhered to.  When she announced she was not leaving the next day,  we told her that was against our agreement and was not tenable, as we could not enjoy our stay with such overzealous surveillance (hovering).  She stated it was her place, she could do what wanted and she planned to stay indefinitely.   We were left with no reasonable choice but to get last-minute flights, quickly pack our bags and miss the last half of our NYC stay.  She was fine with that and never offered to return any of the nearly $2,000.00 wasted.  In all our years of travel throughout the world (including dozens of home exchanges and a number of Airbnb stays) we have never experienced anything like this debacle.  We would have put up with the inaccuracies, inconveniences and excessive regulations/rules, but not her unexpected presence and hovering.  The only positive memory we left with was meeting her cute little dog.  And as an aside, we have always left exchange and Airbnb units at least as clean and neat as when we arrived.

I did not know what to expect, for I typically reside in hotels whenever I travel out of my home state Arizona, but after my experience with Arlette and her apartment in Manhattan, I likely will not return to AirBnb. I came with my mom and my 19 year old sister. Arlette was not in the home when we arrived, but she told us to be expecting her on either Wednesday or Friday of the week we were staying.<br/><br/>Room: The beddings had old yellow stains. The third day a cockroach was found in the shower inside of the bathroom which was surprising because we expected the room to be clean and it appeared so until then. The bathroom door barely could shut so there was a lack of privacy. The bathroom itself was tiny, the sink, toilet, and shower were all close together. There were random clothes hung up, reducing closet space and hanger availability in our room.<br/><br/>General Apartment: Outside of the private room was hot and had an unpleasant smell because there was no AC ventilation on and we were told by Arlette that only the windows could be down outside of the bedroom and the AC should not be turned on even though it was humid in NY and it was summer in August. We bought air fresheners and disinfectants to combat the smell for the rest of the stay. The power also went out randomly and we had to call Arlette to get directions to turn it back on. <br/><br/>Arlette: She had her friend who had a dog and was a stranger to us come in to the home to wait in the apartment due to gas inspection which should have been done before we arrived or if she had no power over that she should have rejected our stay because we had delay our day and wait in our rooms since we did not have a key to lock our bedroom and protect our things. We were also notified about this inspection the morning of which was unprofessional. <br/><br/>The living room is available to guests, so I decided to read one of the books in Arlette’s book shelf. Maus and I took out a fan from our bedroom’s closet and placed it in the living room since it was humid in the living room from lack of AC. Since it is our first time using AirBnb we thought that since the washer and dryer was not included it meant not present so we called Arlette when we saw it, asking if we could use it and she said no since it is not available to guests and it is broken from other guests who used it and instead advised us to use a laundromat nearby in which we happily used our fourth day staying there. <br/><br/>On the fourth day, (Thursday) in the evening, my mother, sister, and I came back to the apartment from a long day on the Staten Island ferry and shopping. We had ran out of toilet paper that day and we planned to buy some since we could not find any in the apartment even in the area where Arlette had last told us from our previous phone call concerning trash bags.<br/><br/>When we walked down the hall, we saw that Arlette’s bedroom and bathroom were open, but she was not present in the apartment. We were not expecting her and assumed she had left after just checking on things so we went into our room. My mom was preparing to rest, while my sister and I were touching up our makeup to head out again. <br/>My mom locks the apartment by placing the chain lock for safety and mind you we have been doing this throughout our stay since we are not from NY and have read about the breaking and entering and crime cases. We began to hear a strange noise. We went out of the room and saw that it was Arlette shouting for us to unlatch the chain lock. We did happily and apologized. She then told us not to add the chain lock because it was a hazard for firefighters who would have to get in case of a fire as well as it would make it hard for her to come in . We then asked why it was there and she said it’s there just to be there but New Yorkers do not use it. She then asked us if we used her bathroom or ate in our rooms and we said no and she thanked us.  We said our goodbyes to Arlette and my mom stayed back locked inside our room.<br/><br/>My sister and I come back to the apartment, and see Arlette outside our room door with my mom inside it. I knocked on our door because my mom had locked herself in. She opens the door for us and Arlette begins to talk to us as we are standing outside of the door in the hallway. Arlette tells me that my mom would not open our door and she was being rude to her and refused to speak with her. Although my mom told her it was because she was naked and had just showered. She also accused us of using her washer and dryer and breaking it and that she found her clothes soaked in the washing machine.<br/><br/>Arlette also blew up at me because I had used her fan and read her Maus book that was on top of the living room table.

I had agreed to a later check out time with the owner prior to booking the apartment, but ended up being abruptly forced out of the apartment hours prior to the agreed check out time.  So needless to say, we had to pack and leave within 30 minutes of finding out that the cleaning lady was on her way.

We live in a huge city with nightly helicopters, etc. We also love the West Village, having stayed there countless times, including on Horatio, 8th, and 10th. So *believe me* when I tell you this level of noise is un-freaking-bearable. There\\'s a club nearby that plays loud live music from 10:00pm until 3:00am Every. Single. Night. For many people this isn\\'t a problem. If you’re in NYC to party until after 3:00am, if you sleep like the dead, or if you’re hearing impaired, you won’t be bothered. But this place is listed as family/kid friendly and it isn\\'t. It also says it has working smoke detectors and it doesn’t. I only noticed this because the bedroom A/C was plugged in half way and kept shorting out every time I touched it. Now about the words “LUXURY” and “LOVELY.” Um, no. It’s 1/3 Nice, 1/3 Meh and 1/3 Holy-crap-that’s-gross. The living room is nice. Very large by NY standards, with high ceilings and tasteful (if maritime steampunk) decor. Totally different furniture than the pictures, but we didn\\'t care. The bedrooms are small, but the bed we lay awake in all night saying FML was comfortable (although when we pulled the sheets there was a mysterious stain on the mattress). But what’s really gross is the bathroom. The shower is yucky, and the floor is sticky with that unmistakable old-urine-seeped-into-the-floor-forever smell. There were a bunch of cockroaches at night. I caught a picture of one cute little “evening-time” roach, but was too freaked to take a picture of the 5-6 roaches that scattered during the night. None of the doorknobs work, but for some reason the bathroom door is scotch-taped open. There is an enormous pile of garbage —er, sorry, “Recycling” outside the front door. Honestly, the garbage and the roaches can be very common for NYC, especially on the 1st floor, but you shouldn’t throw around the words LUXURY and LOVELY.

According to the host someone had come earlier in the day to “clean”….<br/><br/>=Bathroom=<br/>The bathroom was clogged the day I arrived. It was in the morning when I tried using it and it was clogged. Had to contact the host twice since he wasn’t replying. His solution? Use the plunger…which I had already done….his next solution? Go and talk to the superintendent and fetch a better plunger….I went and met the lovely superintendent Michele who gave me the other plunger….the toilet was still clogged and spilling dark (Website hidden by Airbnb) Michele had to come after she was done with her duties to unclog it…which in the end meant I couldn’t use the toilet in 6 hours in total? Then we realized the bathtub was also clogged. For this we had to wait for Michele’s husband to come help her unclog it using a machine….which meant more waiting.<br/><br/>Overall the bathroom was DISGUSTING. It was not clean at all. There were long hairs everywhere. The tiles of the bathtub, the walls were gray from dirt. It looks like the bathroom hadnt been cleaned not in months but more than a year or years???? Even Michele commented on the state of the apartment itself and the dirty ness of it…..<br/><br/>There were some towels that used to be white but were now grey and full of stains waiting for me to dry my hands….disgusting…in the end i had to buy towels at Target<br/><br/>So i had to spend my first two days CLEANING the whole apartment <br/><br/>The host’s attitude was awful….after I sent him a message about the bathroom being clogged he was like: “oh Michele will fix it so there is no issue” and he seem to downplay everything that was happening, the dirt, the mice, etc….when he should be ashamed of this mess and then he got mad because I dared contact the airbnb team about his mess of an apartment….<br/><br/>=Kitchen=<br/>Dirty. Crusted stuff inside the microwave…a lot of it….there were dirty towels next to the sink. The mini oven is absolutely dirty.seems like it has never been cleaned. There was no space for me to put things in the fridge, which is FULL of stuff and has a weird smell. <br/><br/>=Bedroom=<br/>This is the HARDEST mattress I have ever slept in. I’m not very picky when it comes to mattresses but I thought it was a JOKE when I sat on the bed….everything in the room is dusty and full of things. Overall it feels and is dirty. There was no space for me to out my clothes even though the host knew I was gonna stay here for a month.<br/><br/>There is no remote control for the AC so you have to get what the AC gives you. There are spaces between the AC and the wall. <br/><br/>=THE MICE=<br/>Yep, there is a mouse or many of them? I don’t know if it was always the same. So after putting up with all that what I described before and spending the first 3-4 days of my stay buying cleaning products (because there were none of very old ones in the apartment) I thought everything was clean when I was brushing my teeth and saw something walk from the hall into the kitchen….a MOUSE….that’s when after sending all the pictures from the dirty ness of the place to Airbnb and informing them of the state of the apartment had to spend the whole day on the phone with them trying to see if I could be moved to another place….of course this is not possible since its NYC and finding accommodation from one day to another is literally impossible. So I ended up staying. And this is not new or something that has never happened here….according to the superintendent mice can be found in the apartment during the summer, which of course was not mentioned in the Airbnb ad. <br/><br/>So the mouse was running around the kitchen, on the dishes, on the stove….you can imagine how hygienic that all is…..<br/><br/>=CLEANING=<br/>So i was here for a month…I’m not so sure but I would think someone should have come to clean the , change bedsheets once per week? Even Michele offered the host to come and do it….she didn’t get a reply from the host. I’m a clean person so I kept things clean for myself. So in the end I cleaned and Michele cleaned again after I cleaned around 5 days after my arrival and that was it. <br/><br/>Overall you are left to fix things yourself with the help of Michele, who’s an angel. The host is somewhere in California so if things go wrong like in this case its up to you to fix basic things that should not be your responsibility as a guest. It seems like this place is just to make money out of it without investing the minimum. <br/><br/>It is a shame because the apartment itself is not bad. The location is great.

I had just moved to nyc & was looking for apartments & I was actually considering this apartment as well. Izi was good at communication from the beginning. During my check in Elio lifted the two heavy bags all by himself since it’s a walk up building. They are nice hosts. So first 15 days went smooth but then on 15th night a big roach came out in my room. I have stayed in nyc before but never had anything in my apartment but this was first time. Izi had been nice in communication but this was unfortunate. I had to kill it myself. Izi came the next day & put everything traps in place and said he did not find anything. I did feel there were gaps inside the walls that needed to be sealed because this would not be the last time I would see it. Also when he came to check the apartment, I was there but he was unaware & he was showing the apartment to some other tenant, which I found not ok because my stuff was lying there and he should have taken my permission before showing it to someone else. Then that night I heard scratches in the wall from a rat. I told Izi the next day but he implied that I could be hearing the noises from the fridge and that the building does not have any pest problems. So I shrugged it thinking maybe he was right but I do know the difference between a rat & a fridge noise. Then on 17th night as I turned on the AC from above, a big roach fell from it! Thank god I was not standing below the AC! So I took a video and sent it to Izi but again he said he did not see anything. So I requested him to come to the apartment. Izi came all the way from New Jersey at 9 pm and took care of the roach. So Izi told me He will call an exterminator tomorrow. He did say that they did some plumbing work from the apartment above and kept the valve open & so two of them might have come from there. But I could not wait for anything to show up again so I decided to stay at my friend’s place till the exterminator came. The exterminator came on 19th instead of the next day because he was booked on 18th. The exterminator did say that there might be some gaps from where the roaches could come but that he did not see any rat and he put extra traps for extra precautions, which was fine. So this disturbed my stay because people would come & go from the apartment & Izi did say he would take care of it but it was causing a lot of inconvenience as I was looking for longer term Apartmrnts & trying to work. Now since these were row houses, two buildings down from Izi’s did have rat extermination treatments going on so it is possible that the rat scratching noise I heard could have come from other neighboring building. Whatever the case, I have stayed in other airbnbs & I have stayed in nyc for more than two years & in other places but I never had such roach come out on two consecutive nights. Izi said that he will look into the AC and seal the gaps wherever needed but I could not bear more inconvenience & the charges for the apartment were not less compared to the inconvenience I went through. So I told Izi I needed a refund for the rest of my stay and that I had decided to leave and we did have a discussion & he said he was doing everything & that I was breaking the lease based on my feeling that something would come out even though he said they will fix it. But I already gave him two chances and he should have fixed it before renting this apartment. His tone became unappreciative but he was accommodative and he himself called Airbnb and asked for refund to me. Airbnb gave me the refund. And then Izi told me I could help him out by accepting the link on Airbnb that said he would move me to another apartment so that he could market this apartment but Airbnb said it was not possible so Izi called me again in few days saying that he would talk to someone experienced at Airbnb again to send me the link showing that he had moved me to another apartment so that he could market this apartment, since I had left the apartment. Anyways so far this was the most unfortunate experience I had with Airbnb except for one time in Naples, Italy & it’s super host Izi & I hope this was just an anomaly that’s all I can say!',\n  -0.0022222222222222227),\n (999984,\n  'We had high expectations from the description and pictures on Airbnb, however, were disappointed by several things. First, as someone from a design background, I was attracted to the aesthetic and decor in the online photos, but showed up to find much of the design elements had been removed, walls mostly blank, including the large sculpture and print between the windows in the living room and bedroom, many plants gone or dead, the ottoman in the living room was gone, most of the pillows were gone from the couch, the coffee table was empty, and most of the other designer details gone - disappointing and misrepresented in the photos.  A large tangled pile of electric cords and extension cords sat visible on the living room floor running to the TV area and was unsightly and undoubtedly a fire hazard.<br/><br/>We found the apartment cleaned poorly, with dust in many areas, the couch was badly stained in several places and dirty / smelly, and there were many used mostly empty bottles of toiletries in the tub area with stains around them suggesting they were never moved or the tub fully cleaned before we arrived. We pulled a comforter out of the closet to use one night and it had unknown gross stains on it so we did not use it.<br/><br/>When we arrived the key to the front of the building got stuck in the lock and could not be removed. The host owners were apparently not in town and we never heard from them personally, instead a coordinator contacted us ( He was very nice) and said we would have a new key that evening or in the morning, however, we never heard back and had to contact again a day later, and then never got a key until someone finally replaced the faulty lock the day before we were to leave. For the majority of our several day stay we were left to fiddle with the key sometimes for 10-15 minutes until it could be removed randomly. Not much fun coming home each time only to be stuck outside trying to recover the key so we could leave and return again...a real pain in the vacation. Very slow response to remedy this issue, and apparently this had been reported by previous guests but not resolved prior to our stay.<br/><br/>The location in town was convenient to subways and the local neighborhood had some fine restaurants and bars, however, during our stay there was constant ongoing major renovations to the street, as well as of the building to the immediate side and across the street so it was noisy and the street and sidewalks a mess with piles of trash, work vehicles, and scaffolding. This should be made apparent in the listing and /or the price adjusted for this unexpected inconvenience, eyesore, and noise. <br/><br/>Overall good location in NYC, but considering the many issues I mention we felt the place was misrepresented on Airbnb, and we left feeling we were overcharged at over $400 a night.

The area, mid-60s, East side, were excellent--safe, clean, and accessible.   Other than that, I have very little positive to say.  Upon arriving in NY, I went immediately to the hospital to see my son before going to the apartment.  It was approximately 11:30 PM when I finally arrived at the apartment.  Aside from noticing that there was no elevator and the apartment was n the 4th floor, I also observed that the room was quite small, smaller than my son's hospital room.  I immediately went to bed and it wasn't until the next morning that I discovered large stains on the top bed sheet.  Upon changing the sheets, I then discovered a large brownish red stain on the mattress cover.  There was absolutely no place to hang any of my clothes.  I spent the week living out of my suitcase.  It was only on the last day that I received an SMS notifying me that there was a device under the bed for hanging clothing.  Why was this not already set up for potential guests?  why were there no instructions informing guests of this device?  I had no internet service the entire week despite following the published instructions to the letter.  I did have internet services in the hospital and every restaurant I visited.  Upon opening the refrigerator, I was struck by a thick cloud of foul and putrid air.  I never used the refrigerator or kitchen for the entire week.  I observed at least two dark brown substances on the hard wood floors, either mud, melted chocolate, or fecal matter.  The apartment on the second floor was undergoing renovation, which left the stairwell thick with dust and debris the entire week.  No effort was made to clean the stairwell every day after the workers departed.  Every step on the carpet produced a cloud of dust and the stair rail was covered with a film of dust.  Prospective guests should have been informed of this inconvenience.  A large sky light was positioned over the bed with no way to darken the window  when  sleeping.  Perhaps romantic for some but not conducive to sleeping for others. The bathroom was small with no room to place toiletries except on the back of the toilet. I killed a tick in the bathroom.   In conclusion, I found the overall experience fully unacceptable and strongly encourage any would be guests to look elsewhere.

This is my experience:<br/><br/>1.\\tLocation: the apartment is located two blocks south of MSG stadium and PENN Station. Very practical, good commute, almost in the middle of the city, you have quick access to many places. Unfortunately, due to the current difficult situation as well, the whole area is full of homeless and mentally unstable people. Moreover, poor lighting in the area makes things even more difficult at night. A short time after I moved in, I found FECES on a rug INSIDE the main hall. I called the host, who is also the building manager, and he took care of it in short time.<br/><br/>2.\\tApartment: the building is very old and so is the apartment. (Website hidden by Airbnb) a.\\tI found old and rusty appliances and furniture, a broken wardrobe and a bandy mattress (probably overused). Very dirty, too. All the narrow spaces (sink-stove, behind the fridge, behind the heater, below the bed) filled with spider webs, dust and small pieces of trash. (Website hidden by Airbnb) b.\\tThe toilet is extremely narrow and sensitive. I had to buy a plunger because it would clog after a simple use, with absolutely NO paper throwing whatsoever (Website hidden by Airbnb) c.\\tThe window curtains are smaller than the actual window, so there’s no shade from morning light. (Website hidden by Airbnb) d.\\tThe window DOESN’T have a mesh screen. That, along with the fact that the apartment faces a lame backyard FULL of rats (and not the two-block-away-HighLine, in case somebody thinks that because of the pictures on the listing), meant that I had to be right next to the window every time I opened it in order to avoid very unpleasant intrusions. (Website hidden by Airbnb) e.\\tWhy did I have to open the window? Because there was NO ABSORBER in the kitchen. I had to finish cooking and then try to clear out the smokey room, so I could be checking the window. I even had to take the batteries out of the “remote” (a.k.a. uninstalled) smoke detector that the host handed me, because the alarm would sound. (Website hidden by Airbnb) f.\\tWasher/dryer: the best and the only true correspondence between the listing and the actual apartment. Does exactly and efficiently the job it’s made for. <br/><br/>3.\\tNoise: the walls in this building are the THINNEST you can possibly imagine. I could hear all the other tenants, even when they were just talking, as if they were in my apartment. But what was absolutely unbearable, was the 24hour screeching sound of the old, wooden floor from the apartment just above me, where the tenant was just living his life and nothing more than that. <br/><br/>4.\\t Heating: the absolute disaster. I complained many times to the host about its inefficiency, and he told me it was generally regulated to work at 70F during day and night drops to 65F. I didn’t use a thermometer to verify. All I know is that there would be times during day that I was stifling (especially when I had the stove on for cooking) and had to open the window (and do the whole process that came with that!) to put cold air in and there would be times during night that the heating just wouldn’t go on, leaving me freezing. The heater is very old and every time it took on early morning it would wake me up with its loud release valve sound. <br/><br/>The host offered me as a solution a second comforter implying in a pejorative tone that I’m not used to cold climates because of where I come from (Greece). FYI, my hometown, Thessaloniki, has the same latitude as NYC, so I have quite some experience with real cold. As a result, instead of suffocating under the weight of two comforters every night, I ended up buying a small heater which helped a lot, even though there were some incredibly cold nights where nothing could be done. Adding to all that, the significant heat loss from the “in-out” air-condition unit with scotch tape and aluminum foil around as insulation. <br/><br/>Final Conclusions: <br/>  <br/>The listing and the actual apartment have absolutely NO CORRESPONDENCE to each other.<br/>Renters, save your time, your money and your HEALTH by not booking this apartment.<br/><br/>Owner(s), gut renovate the place or put it out of the market because right now it’s absolutely NOT LIVABLE, especially for long-time stay. <br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: my review is SOLELY regarding the apartment and the building. The tenants have been absolutely great. The host was reachable and typically accommodating (offered the comforter solution, cleared the feces, gave me the mailbox key when I asked for it), not willing to go the extra mile, though, and be of actual help.  He went rather moody every time I expressed a complaint and almost “talked me out” of even writing a review in a conversation we had, when he realized it wouldn’t be a completely good one.

We are familiar with the Upper West Side, and the apartment was quite conveniently located for the subway downtown and Central Park.   \\r<br/>The main positives for us were:  the excellent space for both our living and sleeping arrangements, the well equipped kitchen and the use of a washing machine and drier in the apartment.    \\r<br/>However, there were a few problems which had a material impact on our stay.\\r<br/>The most critical issue was finding a mouse active in the kitchen trash bucket.   Fortunately, we were able to trap it and release it on the street away from the house.  We photographed the mouse and sent it on to Cedric as a record.  This was very distressing and alarming. We couldn’t help thinking there might be more pests around and it certainly limited our use of the kitchen from then on.  No one really wanted to open the cupboards for fear of what we might find.  We did not tell our son because he would have insisted that we move to a hotel, an option which was also on our minds.  We reported the mouse to Cedric but no remedial action occurred nor any conclusion or assessment to the pest situation which left us in a very uncertain and anxious state. \\r<br/>Other problems fall into the category of annoyances.

The owner told us that having two showers was sufficient for a couple and a baby, and that even hotel have problems. We agree that hotels also problems, and that they issue refunds accordingly.

I had to call our host and it wasn\\'t until he told me that they should be behind the register that I was able to get them.

When we finally arrived (we had to walk more than 20 mins with our luggage from another subway station because the subway station near her house was under construction that weekend), we couldn’t find the doorbell. So we tried to call her numerous times, but she didn’t pick up for an hour! We started panicking a little. When she finally called back, she said we were at the wrong place. Apparently we were provided with the wrong address! And we had to walk another 15 mins with our heavy luggage to her house.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Veronique’s house is situated at the 5th floor, so make sure you are not afraid to walk some stairs. Her apartment is at a very good location, the subway station is just under 5 mins walking and it’s a lively neighborhood.

It’s small but fits 2 people perfectly. The bed is comfortable.  The fans were a little dusty though. The kitchen is well equipped and there’s always filtered water in the fridge.  The bathroom is really small; you can’t turn around or wash your face properly in the sink. Also the bathroom is not very clean, she puts the cat litter box in the bathtub that you have to temporarily remove when you take a shower. And the bathroom door can’t be locked which does feel a tad insecure. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Because temperatures were hitting 35 degrees, on the last night, we asked whether we could use the airco. While I was away, Veronique had a casual conversation with my boyfriend in which she only briefly mentioned about putting the airco on low to avoid power shortage. When later that night I turned on the airco, all the power of the house was suddenly cut down. Without electricity, it was a really unpleasant night since the room is quite muggy. Afterwards Veronique blamed us for not listening to her, while she has never told us both explicitly not to put the airco on high or warned us in a clear way. She claimed that she also sent a text with the instructions for the airco, which I have never seen or received. When we checked out, we told her we are sorry but she said she would complain to Airbnb about us and was constantly suggesting that we should pay for the financial damage (because of her lost food in her fridge and the tip she paid the repairman), which we thought was really unfair to us.

There are mice!, and now we understand one of the rules of the house that the owner sent us two days before our arrival: \"Do not leave any food debris on the kitchen counter. We don\\'t want any unwanted guests.\". No wonder there are mice and more, the house is dirty, starting with the windows that have not been cleaned for more than a year and that make the house even darker. At the counter that appears in the photos with a mirror and lights, everything is clear in the photos... but the real thing was that underneath it was full of bags with clothes and things, and other clothes on the floor, a static bicycle in its packaging ... that makes it a nest to hide mice and any bug. The drawers and furniture in the kitchen are full of dirty and messy things. The pans and pots were so dirty that they could not be used. We had to wash with care the minimum things to be used these days. The microwave was not working, and the owner had to know it in advance because when we told him we had prepared a spare one that he left at the door, but as for our complaint of disorder, he ignored it and for cleaning he wanted to send us again to the cleaning lady, which we refused because it meant staying at home to see how she cleaned. The bedroom closet is full of things (air conditioners, paintings, old lamps ...) that make it possible to use only 50 cm to hang clothes. We told the owner and he just sent us ..... more hangers !!. The bathroom was clean, but the closet that is there, is filthy, with traces of things that someone should use (razors, liquids, empty containers, remnants of creams and pastes) it can not be used to store anything. The hair dryer that they say there is, is not seen and it\\'s scary to look for it in the mess of junk that there is in the whole house. On our arrival two used towels were hung in the bathroom. Fortunately, my wife did not see the mice and was not aware of it until we were at the airport, otherwise we would not have been able to sleep there, and I say sleep because in view of this situation we have preferred to spend as little time as possible in the apartment. We feel cheated, and we can not understand that nobody has commented so far on all this (it is seen that it is not a thing of two days ago, but a deterioration continued and accumulated for quite some time). I would never go back to this apartment and I would never recommend it to anyone and I think that we should inform the Airbnb organization so that no one will see themselves in such a situation. Things that in other cases we would comment, in this already considered of little importance, as is the theme of bad lighting, especially in the bedroom where the lamp is constantly switched off and on, the curtains half off, the headboard of the bed full of clutter from behind (and go know more) And as for the presence of mice, they have not been seen once, but several times coming out from behind the fridge and scampering to hide in a closet that is at the entrance of the apartment closed with a padlock. I find it incredible because the owner is aware and still does not remedy and continues to rent, at the price of 4 * hotels). Finally note that during our stay one day someone entered with a key in the apartment during our absence, or at least without using force, he forgot an object on the kitchen counter that we left there in the same place, just in case decides to look for it again.

El microondas no funcionaba, y lo debía de saber con antelación el propietario porque cuando se lo dijimos ya tenía preparado uno de repuesto que nos dejó en la puerta, pero en cuanto a nuestra queja de desorden no hizo caso y para la limpieza nos quería mandar de nuevo a la señora de la limpieza, que rehusamos porque ello implicaba quedarnos en casa para ver como limpiaba.

The room was as-pictured with plenty of space for me and my daughter, and the corner desk was perfect for toiletries, maps, souvenirs, etc. There was a shelf in the refrigerator for us and access to the kitchen, dishes, and silverware as needed. We felt subway stations, and we were able to travel easily around NYC. \\r<br/>Great eclectic neighborhood, especially Pies and Thighs and the Essex Street Market. I would describe it as \"unpolished\" (no marble entries or uniformed doormen) yet safe.  We felt secure, even late at night. Expect an absence of curb appeal, it\\'s not much to look at from the outside.\\r<br/>The space could definitely use some detailed cleaning and maintenance. While I would not describe it as dirty, it was not cleaned to the standards I would expect for paid lodging. We found a previous guest\\'s sock and shoe and dust piles under the second bed (futon), indicating that the room had not been thoroughly cleaned between guests (how could you miss a sock and a shoe?). The futon cover needed a good washing / replacement. The bathroom was in desperate need of an overhaul. The metal (stainless steel?) walls just seemed dirty all the time, the toilet and shower needed detailed cleaning, the grout was cracked and dirty, and parts of the wall to ceiling seams were open. It looked like they were originally covered by a metal seam tape that was no longer holding. The vanity was slightly too small for the space, which wouldn\\'t have been a problem except for the 1/2 inch gap between the sink and the tub with unknown dirt and trash permanently stuck in a space too small to clean out. The size of the bathroom was OK, but the layout was awkward and the space needs to be cleaned and brightened up. As a renter, Jackie probably can\\'t do renovations, but someone needs to give that bathroom some self-esteem and a reason to live! One other issue that arose was the steam radiator system. We left the radiator in our room off, but the heat coming off the exposed pipe made the room uncomfortably hot. We literally had to run the window A/C unit even though it was 35 degrees outside because the room was so warm. \\r<br/>All that being said, even considering the sad bathroom, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives, and I hope to stay with Jackie again as soon as possible.

Trash cans (not trash containers, but plastic buckets) were to blame for this and obviously mice. Mice were coming at night to eat out of those plastic trash buckets and left their droppings (shit) behind. My entry into the building looked like I was walking on the minefield. After entering the building’s door, there was a notice with legal articles and sections from building’s management that it is illegal to use this place for Airbnb guests, walking one flight up another notice from PEST CONTROL, once in a month (every first Saturday) there will be an exterminator coming for free.

We also wanted somewhere where we could rest and fix a simple meal now and then. This place seemed to fit all our requirements. Airbnb’s app makes it very easy to choose and secure our rental.

Filled out and returned several times but never received (I still do not know if she ever got it)? We arrived during the stated check in time. We were greeted by our host. She opened a bottle of white wine and served everyone including herself. Then she opened her three ring binder and went into detail explanation page by page on what she had included in the binder. This went on for almost an hour and would have gone on longer if she had opened the second bottle of wine she offered. We begged off stating we needed to go out to eat.

The patio with few plants (not like the photos which showed to in lovely green with flowers) and parts and pieces from past projects plus a fake still decorated Christmas trees with a thick layer of dirt in one of the flower beds.

The radiators and pipes were all emitting high amounts of heat so I called the landlord Antonio to turn off the radiator and pipes because it was super hot in the room, I was sweating and had trouble breathing. Antonio said there was no way to turn off the pipes because it would shut off for the whole building and the maintenance was only able to shut off the radiator (not the pipe) in the room, the other radiator had a broken  part and needed fixing. When he told me he couldn't turn off the heat I immediately said I want a refund so I could check into a hotel. Antonio refused to give a refund for the stay, wouldn't allow me to cancel, he tried offering a different apartment in the building but it was just as hot, the entire building was a melting pot. This company appears to be false advertising(especially air conditioning the little AC unit in the kitchen was basically useless) and what's worse is they're putting people in dangerous environments, If it had been someone with underlying conditions it could be much worse so airbnb should definitely investigate this company. The living room was the hotest and the wifi only worked in the living so it was hell, I was miserable I couldn't enjoy anything even eating my food, I started getting nose bleeds. To add to all of it the kitchen floor had no padding it almost fell like the wood would break at any moment it felt hollow and was super squeaky. The shower water had barely any water pressure, the curtains are literally made of paper and everything in the apartment is made out've cheap wood and masqueraded to make it look better. Communication was horrible, Antonio wouldn't respond to texts or calls so my only resort was to contact airbnb get a refund and leave. This is the first I've dealt with airbnb customer service and to be honest they weren't great they kept throwing my case around from one agent to the next,  I had to call like 15 times, some agents were nice some weren't as much but they failed to see the urgency of the situation that they were keeping me in an unlivable situation, they kept me waiting for 2 days until finally one very nice agent addressed my issue refunded me and I left to a hotel, I just didn't have the luxury of booking a hotel stay while also paying for the airbnb I'm just visiting NY for a couple months and I don't live on a NY salary so I was forced to stay until I was issued a refund. I really hope you come across this comment before booking and avoid this terrible experience.\",\n  -0.006106870229007633),\n (5706280, 'I stayed here for 3 months without any major issues', -0.1),\n (5770483,\n  'You can’t go wrong by contacting Monica about her place in NYC',\n  -0.07142857142857142),\n (5772667, 'Great place to rent.

First, I have to say that Tom is extremely responsive and accommodating. He provides all information you need with clarity and detail. This was very important to us, as we were coming from a far away country (Greece) and we wanted to feel that we can always ask and get a quick and helpful response. Thank you Tom for this. However, we were unhappy with the apartment itself as it was lacking the basic, minimum and reasonably expected qualities and it was not 100% how you expect it to be based on the description and the photos. Specifically:<br/>1. Some dirty parts - the air ventilation fan on the ceiling was full of thick (probably from ages ago) dust and there were some human hair in one of the bath towels that there were left in the apartment. In addition, there were some -small to be honest- bits of left overs from food in the refrigerator. Even the cleaning sponge in the kitchen was dirty, looked like used many times from previous visitors. Shower gel, hand-wash etc., they were all half full and used, not brand new. There were even scratches on the walls and a strange liquid on one of the main pipes in the sofa-bed area (dark brown liquid). <br/>2. Noice coming from some appliances inside the apartment - where do I start with this one. The refrigerator (to be precise the freezer) was making non-stop, unbelievable and to describe it accurately “unbearable” noise. Remember this is a studio apartment and every noise is like next to you. We were forced to turn it off completely cause we could not sleep and this was for the whole two weeks - translating to extra costs for buying breakfast and food from outside as could not store anything in the refrigerator. Now, the heating unit. Even though this one did not produce non-stop noise, nonetheless, when it did, especially during the night, the noise was loud enough to wake me up, making it extremely difficult -if not impossible- to sleep again. At least for a light sleeper like me - my friend was not so bothered by this noise to be honest as he is a heavy sleeper.<br/>3. Some broken items in the apartment - A shelve door in the cabinet (under the unit in the middle) was broken, it fell on my knee while standing next to it. The same goes for one of shower sliding doors in the bathroom. In addition, and this was very very disappointing, the sliding covers in one window (the blinds/shades) were half broken, totally in contrast with the pictures available, which resulted to no privacy -neighbours can properly see you- and a lot of light coming into the apartment from very early in the morning, causing again severe problems with the sleep. Honestly, I was waking up 5:30-6 every day. <br/>4. Not accurate description of the distance to Times Square - in the description of the apartment, it is mentioned, that that the closest train from the apartment to Times Square is 2 stops, while the closest train station is at least 6 stops to Times Square.<br/>One last thing is that after reporting the above problems to Tom, he came into the apartment, in order to fix some of them, without us being present nor letting us know in advance and consenting for him to go into the apartment. We really felt that our privacy was invaded, big time, and this was something that made us feel very very uncomfortable - this was the last thing we wanted to feel especially as we were visiting from a far away.  I understand and appreciate that he had good intentions as he wanted to take care of the above problems ASAP -he could not reach us on the phone- but we were not expecting him to come into the apartment without us being present or having previously consented.<br/>Hopefully (and I believe he will) Tom will address the above issues in order to match the minimum expectations of every visitor, irrespective of whether it is AirBnB or hotel, to such a wonderful city like NYC.

We stayed here for one week and although the location is great and the house itself is a good space, the severe lack of cleanliness left us deeply regretting renting this house. The house was very much in need of a deep clean. The carpets were very dirty with an odour (they need to be steam cleaned), the bathroom floors were extremely dirty and needed a proper clean, not just a weekly wipe between guests, the shower curtains and showers were very dirty and mouldy, there was dried blood on the sofa, pillows and duvets. I don’t mind cheap ikea plates but these were very old and scratched, the cooking pans and teflon pan were mostly scratched. I had to clean urine splatters off one toilet as the toilet had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. The curtains were stained and dust had collected behind furniture - obviously each week just a mild clean between guests is performed so the house has not been cleaned thoroughly for a long time.

Unfortunately, that’s where the positive ended. We’re very familiar with NYC and have stayed in several airbnb’s (old, new, all over Manhtattan, in France and in Los Angeles) and this is simply the worst conditions we’ve ever experienced. The least of the problems beginning with the Hell’s Angels clubhouse across the street firing up their motorcycles all night long (which should have been mentioned in the listing.) The apartment was shockingly dirty to the point where we weren’t going to stay in the apartment at all but had no alternative because of our busy schedule in the city. The fridge was filthy and unusable, there was stench to the sheets and pillows that can only be compared to urine, there was a hamper full of the hosts dirty clothes and sheets next to the desk we planned on working from, there was no proper sheets for the futon, we were left with half a roll of toilet paper for 4 days and had to purchase our own, there was no smoke detector in the apartment and very sketchy wiring, the neighbors in the building were incredibly loud and both doors to enter the building had to have been entered and exited loudly 30 times in the middle of the night each night, bits of the ceiling fell onto our daughters head while sitting on the couch/futon and continued to fall on the futon all night. Last but definitely not least, the factor that caused us to leave before the end of our stay… RODENTS. We were woken up in the night to the sound of rodents chewing through and unopened bag of chips that was on the counter, we then also discovered that a rodent had been in my daughters purse that was on the chair in the living room and had chewed through a sealed granola bar that was in the bag. We ended up driving all night long back to Toronto to avoid spending another night in the apartment.
